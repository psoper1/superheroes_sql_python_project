"""
To use the execute_query function you will need to:
(1) Import it into your python file. 
(2) use it as execute_query(query_string, tuple_with_matching_args)
(3) attach a .fetchone(), .fetchall() to it

Documentation on this can be found at https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/basic/usage.html

Examples:
def select_all_patients():
    query = 
    
        SELECT * from patients
    
    returned_items = execute_query(query).fetchall
    for item in returned_items:
        print(item[1])
    return returned_items

 def create_new_patient(name, bio):
    query = 
        INSERT INTO patients (name, bio)
        VALUES (%s, %s)
        
    execute_query(query, (name, bio))
    
# NOTE: Tuples () with only one argument need to have a trailing comma. 
NOTE2: You may remove the print statements in create_connection() and execute_query() to keep from muddying up your project.
